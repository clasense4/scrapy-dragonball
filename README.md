# Scrapy Dragonball

This Crawler is for crawl a web [Dragonball Multiverse](http://www.dragonball-multiverse.com/).
It will save the images in your local directory. 
Why? because I'm too lazy to check it (read online), and want to download it in my local :)

## How to Use :
1. Clone this repository

        git clone https://github.com/clasense4/scrapy-dragonball.git

2. Edit `scrapy_dragonball/settings.py` change your `scrapy` setting
3. Start your crawler with this command

        $> scrapy crawl scrapy_dragonball

4. Enjoy your dragonball :)

## Notice
The script is still sucks, just for fun, not follow scrapy standards, use at your own risks.
